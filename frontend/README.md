# Bookstore Application

Welcome to the README for the Bookstore Application! This project is a full-stack application that simulates a bookstore specializing in programming and computer science-focused books. It leverages a range of technologies and features to provide a user-friendly experience.

## Technologies Used

1. **Express**: The backend of this application is powered by Express.js, a Node.js web application framework.
2. **Other Supporting Backend Middleware**: Various middleware components are used to enhance the functionality and security of the backend.
3. **SQLite3 and Knex**: The database is implemented using SQLite3, and Knex.js is used as a query builder and ORM to interact with the database.
4. **React**: The frontend of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
5. **Redux**: Redux is used for state management on the frontend, ensuring a predictable and centralized state.
6. **JWT Authentication**: The application employs JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication, ensuring that all API endpoints are password-protected.
7. **RESTful APIs**: All APIs are designed following RESTful principles, making it easy to interact with and manipulate resources.

****Features****

- **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in to access the bookstore's features.
- **Home Page**: The home page displays featured books for the day and offers a visually pleasing UI/UX.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add, remove, increment, and decrement items in their shopping cart.
- **Search Functionality**: A search bar with data list recommendations simplifies finding books.
- **Book Filters**: Users can apply filters to narrow down their book choices.
- **User Profiles**: User profiles include analytics on their favorite types of books and a history of their purchases.
- **Relational Database**: All data is persisted in a relational database created from scratch using Knex and SQLite.
